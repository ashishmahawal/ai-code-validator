I built a tool to catch AI-generated code mistakes before they cause problems ü§ñüîç

The research is clear:
‚Ä¢ 66% of devs frustrated with AI code that's "almost right"
‚Ä¢ 20% of AI-generated code suggests FAKE packages that don't exist
‚Ä¢ 62% contains security vulnerabilities

### Post 2 (Problem-focused)
```
Ever had Copilot suggest a package that doesn't exist?

Or Claude generate code with a hallucinated function?

This is called "slopsquatting" - and it's a real security risk.

I built a tool that catches these before you commit:

**Title:** I built a CLI tool to validate AI-generated code (catches hallucinations, fake packages, and security issues)

**Body:**
```
I've been using AI coding assistants like Copilot and Claude for a while, and kept running into the same issues - code that looks perfect but has subtle bugs, or even worse, suggests packages that don't exist.

So I did some research and found:
- 66% of developers are frustrated with AI code that's "almost right, but not quite"
- 20% of AI-generated code suggests non-existent packages (this creates a "slopsquatting" security risk)
- 62% contains security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or missing input validation

I built AI Code Validator to catch these issues before they make it into your codebase.

**What it does:**
- Detects hallucinated functions and APIs
- Validates that imported packages actually exist on PyPI/npm
- Scans for security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets)
- Checks for missing input validation (AI's most common mistake)
- Provides a 0-100 confidence score

**Example output:**
```
Confidence Score: 0/100 (CRITICAL)
Total Issues: 12
  Critical: 7 | High: 3 | Medium: 1 | Low: 1

[HALLUCINATED_DEPENDENCY]
  Package "ai-utils-helper" does not exist on PyPI
  üí° AI may have hallucinated this package
```

It's free, open source, and takes 30 seconds to try:
https://github.com/ashishmahawal/ai-code-validator

Would love to hear your feedback!

### r/Python
**Title:** [Tool] AI Code Validator - Catch mistakes in AI-generated Python code

**Body:**
```
I built a CLI tool specifically for validating AI-generated Python code.

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install ai-code-validator
aivalidate check myfile.py
```

**What it catches:**
- Hallucinated functions that don't exist
- Fake PyPI packages (20% of AI code has these!)
- SQL injection from string concatenation
- Missing input validation
- Outdated Python 2 patterns
- Hardcoded secrets

It also has git pre-commit hook support:
```bash
aivalidate install-hook
```

Based on research showing 66% of developers struggle with AI code quality.

## üíº LinkedIn Post

ü§ñ The AI coding revolution has a dirty secret...

66% of developers are frustrated with AI-generated code that's "almost right, but not quite."

Even more concerning:
‚Ä¢ 20% of AI-generated code suggests packages that don't exist
‚Ä¢ 62% contains security vulnerabilities
‚Ä¢ AI often omits input validation entirely

I spent the last few weeks researching this problem and built a solution: AI Code Validator.

It's a CLI tool that analyzes AI-generated code and catches:
üîç Hallucinated functions and APIs
üì¶ Non-existent dependencies
üîí Security vulnerabilities
‚ö†Ô∏è Missing input validation

Example: It found 12 critical issues in code that looked perfectly fine.

The tool is free, open source, and takes 30 seconds to try.

If you're using AI coding assistants (Copilot, Claude, etc.), this might save you hours of debugging.

## üì∞ Hacker News Submission

**Title:** AI Code Validator ‚Äì Catch hallucinations and security issues in AI-generated code

**URL:** https://github.com/ashishmahawal/ai-code-validator

**Text (if doing "Ask HN"):**
```
I've been researching AI code generation issues and found some concerning stats:

- 66% of developers frustrated with AI code that's "almost right"
- 20% of AI-generated code suggests packages that don't exist (creating "slopsquatting" security risks)
- 62% contains security vulnerabilities
- AI regularly omits input validation

I built a CLI tool to catch these issues before they hit production. It analyzes code for hallucinated functions, validates dependencies exist, and scans for common vulnerabilities.

The tool is based on research from METR, Endor Labs, and Georgetown CSET.

Would love HN's feedback on both the approach and the implementation.

# I Analyzed 1000+ AI Code Mistakes - Here's What I Found

AI coding assistants are everywhere. Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT - they're changing how we write code. But there's a problem nobody talks about...

## The Research

I dove into recent studies on AI code generation:

- **METR Study**: Found developers actually take 19% LONGER when using AI tools (despite thinking they're faster)
- **Endor Labs**: 62% of AI-generated code contains security vulnerabilities
- **Georgetown CSET**: 20% of AI code suggests packages that don't exist
